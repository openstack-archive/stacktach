## Overview
OpenStack has the ability to publish notifications to a RabbitMQ exchange as they occur. So, rather than pouring through reams of logs across multiple servers, you can now watch requests travel through the system from a single location.

A detailed description of the notifications published by OpenStack [is available here](http://wiki.openstack.org/SystemUsageData)
